# What are the differences in types of congenital heart disease procedures in children during periods of lockdown and relaxation of lockdown, compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic?

## Project description

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated major re-allocation of health care services. Our aim was to assess the impact on pediatric procedures for congenital heart disease during different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period to inform appropriate responses to future major disruptions of health services.
